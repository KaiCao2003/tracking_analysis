# Tracking Analysis

This project provides a small pipeline for analyzing motion tracking CSV files. Configuration is managed entirely through `config.yaml`.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the analysis:
   ```bash
   python -m tracking_analysis.cli --config config.yaml
   ```
   The script will automatically trim the CSV when `preprocess.enable` is `true`.

All plots, trimmed files and statistics are written to the directory specified by `output.output_dir` (default `results/`). When trimming is enabled a summary file is produced alongside the trimmed CSV.

Each run creates a subfolder inside `output.output_dir` named with the current date/time and key settings (interval, filter toggles and markers). The same information is appended to the trimmed CSV and summary file names based on the original input file. The exact configuration used is saved as `config_used.txt` within that folder.

## Configuration Options

Below is an overview of the keys supported in `config.yaml`.

### `input_file`
Path to the CSV file to process.

### `interval`
`start_time` and `end_time` specify the slice of the recording in seconds. Use `null` for `end_time` to include the entire file.

### `time_markers`
List of timestamps (seconds) to highlight on the plots. Markers are drawn as small red triangles so the same event can be located across all figures.

### `groups`
List of rigid-body base names to analyse. An empty list means all available groups.

### `kinematics`
Options for smoothing the computed velocities (`smoothing`, `smoothing_window`, `smoothing_polyorder`, `smoothing_method`).


### `filtering`
Range filters define upper/lower thresholds for linear and angular speed as well as position.

### `no_moving`
Stationary segments are removed when `enable` is `true`. If either linear speed or
angular velocity stays at zero for `window` consecutive frames, that period and the
next `after` frames are discarded.

### `output`
Controls which figures and exports are produced. `full_size_plots` enlarges plots to 16x10 inches. `x_limit` and `y_limit` specify the axis maxima for time-series plots (set to `null` for automatic scaling).

### `preprocess`
If `enable` is true, the CSV is trimmed before analysis and a brief `summary_file` is written. The trimmed and summary files are saved inside the run folder with names derived from the input file and current settings.

You can also run the trimming step manually:

```bash
python -m tracking_analysis.trim <input.csv> [output.csv] --summary summary.txt
```

## Code Structure

The `interactive_app` package is split into small modules so UI logic, data
handling and plotting remain independent:

- `data_utils.py` contains data loading, preprocessing and filtering helpers.
- `plotting.py` defines the functions that build Plotly figures.
- `ui_components.py` holds the Dash form builders used in the configuration
  panel.
- `utils.py` re-exports these helpers for backward compatibility.
- `smoothing.py` defines pluggable smoothing functions used when computing
  velocities.

### Adding smoothing methods

`interactive_app.smoothing` exposes a `register` decorator and an
`apply` helper. Built-in functions are registered with names like
`"savgol"`, `"ema"`, `"window"` and `"lateral_inhibition"`. To add a new
algorithm simply append a function decorated with `@register("my_method")`
in `smoothing.py`. Set `kinematics.smoothing_method` to the same name in
`config.yaml` and both `app.py` and `filter_compare.py` will automatically
use the new smoother.

## Interactive Web Application

The Dash-based web interface mirrors the CLI processing pipeline. It reads
`config.yaml`, applies the same filtering, slicing and smoothing settings and
highlights any time markers. Four interactive graphs are displayed:
3D trajectory, 2D trajectory, linear speed and angular speed. A drop-down menu
lists every filter from `filter_test.filters`, matching the options available in
`filter_compare`. Use the time-range slider to focus on a portion of the
recording. The **Play** button replays the trajectory and marks the current time
across all plots. Clicking a point on any graph highlights the same moment on
the others using grey markers. A collapsible *Edit configuration* window lists
every setting from `config.yaml` with simple form controls. Switches toggle
boolean options and inputs update numeric or text values. Saving reloads the data
without restarting the server.


```bash
python -m interactive_app.app --config config.yaml
```

The app listens on the port specified by `webapp.port` (default `3010`).
If `input_file` does not exist the viewer falls back to `data/input.csv`.




## Filter Comparison Utility

The `interactive_app.filter_compare` script loads the CSV defined by
`input_file`, extracts a oneâ€‘dimensional signal and saves SVG plots for the
configured filters.
The signal source, time interval and filters are controlled by the
`filter_test` section in `config.yaml`, for example:

```yaml
filter_test:
  enable: true
  group: null       # use first group
  source: speed     # or position_x/position_y/position_z
  start_time: 0
  end_time: null
  filters:
    - type: moving_average
      window: 5
    - type: window
      window: 10
```

The `window` filter averages the first and last half of the
configured window.

Run the tool with:

```bash
python -m interactive_app.filter_compare --config config.yaml
```

Generated figures are stored under the `results/` directory.

Legacy callbacks for the old YAML editor remain commented out in
`interactive_app/app.py` for reference. The web interface now exposes a simple
form-based configuration panel instead of a raw text area.
