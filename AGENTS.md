Here si the prompt for this project. 

Please read this csv file and please write a python anaylisis project for me. I would like you to provide these following but not limit to these functions. The code should be highly straightforward, neat, clean, easy to read, easy to extend as well as easy to maintain. The code should be moduled neatly and clearly be seperated into different The code should ready to use by either able to run internally in the IDE or by command line. there should have a interaction with user by either simple command line input and output or by website. If you want to use website, which can only be built by flask module.


here is the function list:
1. first step is determine the time lapse. the actual data can be really big and can have huge number of frames which contains a lot of data per frame. thus, determine the analysis time interval will be important. Does the user want to analysis first 10s? or from 1:00 to 2:30, or entire data? determine it first. 
2. second will be filter out "not useful" data. In this case, due to the nature of measurement, as long as those markers and rigidbodeis are detected, there are fluctuation of the coordinates. So in this step, i would like you to check the x coordinates for all the things's in selected time interval. if they are all same, which means they are not being detected/missing data in this interval. thus, still list them but group out. 
3. as you can see here is a "tracking data" for a group of markers and rigid bodies. What i would like you to do in this step is to group the datas. You can see there are "rigid body" and some names are "rigidbod name: Marker 00X", these are markers that compose the rigid body. Thus, first you may want to group out rigid bodies and their children markers to a group. I mean, group bodies and in each group those markers from that body is also inside. and after this step, user may need to choose one/agroup of bodies/markers to narrow down the data you qant to analyze in the next step. 
4. okay. now, i would like you to obtain these information for future drawing for a series of diagram. You may want to have:  the coordinates and the time stamp, and by these you want to calculate the angular speed, the velocity of the body(s)/marker(s). The velocity and the angular speed can be smoothed if the user requested. The smoothing is being calculated in a matlab code somewhere else. You may want to calculated in a same way or a similar way. Here is the doc: 
5. In this step, please provide a diagram about: The trajectory of the rigid body, include 2d, from top to bottom, and 3d (up-axis is z-axis), the angular speed plot (speed vs t) as well as the velocity plot (v vx t) 6. Provide downloads for all data generated. The plots are the must but anything else can be added like the “filtered” data or marker list. *: all this can be pre configged by a config file. For example, user can define the rigid body /marker they would like to analyze by assign it or assign a series of markers or bodies. They can predefined a lot of things. If those are not exist simply return nothing. All can be defined. 
Can be simply like a bool of whether download the list or whether gen 2d. They can also be left empty and default is false or none, aka skip. 
1. the time interval can be anytime, these are just examples. 
2. you can group by the IDs. a rigid body and markers inside share the same ID
3. user can also add "time marker" for request markers on the final plot on that time point. Like user can add time point at 10s when they want to anlyze data from 1s to 15s. thus, in plots generated, add a marker like a line or triangle to indicate it. time marker shoudo within the selacted time range 
4. the time determined by user should be input as frame in both interval and time marker. the time show in the plot should be time in second or in mm:ss format. 
5. in the trajectory plot, use rainbow color to indicate the start and end. start is cold color and warm color will be end. one round in one trajectory, aka do NOT change the coor back at the middle of the trajactory but just use rainbow color scale to indicate the time in these plots. add a bar next to it indicating start and end.


IGNORE output1.csv if exists. That's a internal testing file shouldn't be uploaded.
